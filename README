This is a really simple RSS feed parser released under the MIT license.
It currently uses an NSXMLParser to populate a NSMutableArray
though I plan on added a new class with a TBXML parser to speed it up.

I appreachiate this isn't a hard thing to make but RSS feeds are pretty
common and I'm making quite a few apps that are going to need an RSS
feed parser so I thought I'd make on that would do all for all of them.
And as I've made it I thought I would share it. Hell it might be of help
to someone.

This currenlty uses ARC but I might make one that doesn't so more people
can use it.

To use it is pretty simple add the RSSXMLParserDelegate and RSSItem
objects to your project. Instanciate the parser with a URL then call:

aMutableArray = [parser getRSSData];

This also unescapes HTML text so data is ready to go straight into a
label. I did adapt that code from some on source forge so I'll get the
authers name commented in with a link next time I work on it.

Demo is very simplistic, just diplays a default RSS feed and has a
crappy detailed view when you click on one.

Happy hacking
