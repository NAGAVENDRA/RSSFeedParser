A simple RSS feed parser that builds an array of RSSItems. Built to RSS
specifications. It uses a TBXML parser. It currenly has a very simple
html unescaper which will need updating.

This currently uses ARC but I might make one that doesn't, so more people
can use it.

To use it is pretty simple add the TBXMLParser with it's required files
and library and add the RSSItem object to your project. 
Instantiate the parser with a URL then call:

aMutableArray = [parser getRSSData];

Demo is very simplistic, just displays a default RSS feed and has a
crappy detailed view when you click on one. Also has the option to 
use an NSXMLParser instead of the TBXML one.

Happy hacking
